# Comparing Front-End Frameworks

I'm using this repo to re-create the same web experience in a variety of frameworks. The idea is to get a sense of their unique strengths.

## SSR - Next, Nuxt, Svelte, Angular

## SPA - Preact, Lit, Solid, Qwik

## SPA - React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular

## Elm, Ember, Backbone, Knockout

## Rails
